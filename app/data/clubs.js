        "description": "Founded on March 18, 1900 AFC Ajax is one of the largest and most storied clubs in European football. After their founding and acceptance into Dutch Football Ajax spent ten seasons in the country's second division before earning    promotion for the 1911 season. The move to the first division did not last long though as just three seasons later the club was    relegated for the first and only time in its illustrious history. The fate of the club quickly changed with the arrival of trainer Jack Reynolds who would spend 35 years at the helm of the team. Under the leadership of this legendary coach Ajax won   their first National Championship in 1918. From that point on Ajax could always be found at or near the top of the Dutch table.   It was also Reynolds and his revolutionary training methods that built the foundation for what has now become the world famous    Ajax Youth Training Program.",

        "description": "FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result of the increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have conferred upon the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to Barcelona and Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming interested in playing sport in Catalonia this social context and Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of a new model of modern leisure. Gamper, the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the Club’s first 25 years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and president.",

        "description": "Strangely enough for such a successful club, Bayern did not set the world alight straight away. After being founded in 1900, the club had to wait until 1932 for its first national championship. One title could not turn their fortunes around, however; in those years, Bayern were derided as 'the Jew's club', and many important Jewish club officials had to leave the country due to the rise of Nazism in Germany. The post-war era brought its own troubles, with the club being relegated in 1955 and narrowly avoiding bankruptcy at the end of the decade. The only bright spot for Bayern was winning their first DFB-Pokal in 1957.",

        "description": "Following the moving of Everton to Goodison Park in 1892, the club's then-president John Houlding suddenly found himself with the rights to Anfield stadium and no team to play on it. Always a practical man, Houlding quickly decided to circumvent this problem by forming his own club – Liverpool. After becoming a member of the Football League in 1893, the team managed to get promoted to first division after one season in the second division. Early on, Liverpool established themselves as one of England's top clubs, winning League titles in 1901, 1906, 1922 and 1923.",

Extremely prestigious wins, obtained in every part of the world prove the unparalleled strength and organization of a great group.",
